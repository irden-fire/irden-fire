For work with this project you need to install node.js, npm, and bower.

After that you need to execute 'bower' command and then 'gulp' command.

If all will be good - you will see working develop server at port 3000, and also,
you can find built project's files and folders in working directory of production
server. (If it differ to /var/www/html don't forget change it, in the file /gulp/gulp.config.js
variable 'prod_dir')
