Irden site, first probe.
In this project I will try, using all modern technologies, make awesome web page for my team.

For work with this project you need install node.js, npm, and bower.
After that you need to execute 'bower' command and then 'gulp' command.
If all will be good - you will see working develop server at port 3000, and also,
you can find built project's files and folders in working directory of production
server. (If it differ to /var/www/html don't forget change it, in the file /gulp/gulp.config.js
variable 'prod_dir')
